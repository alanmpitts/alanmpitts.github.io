title: About me
---

My name is Alan M. Pitts.
- Yes I did put the M. in there. Its a habit that I picked up when I was very young.
- Priorities  in order
  1. Health -- If I'm unhealthy then I can't attend to the rest of this list
  2. Family -- I am a human. Humans are organized around families. Once I realized that, things started to get easier :-)
  3. Work -- I do IT for work. I'm fortunate because for most of my life I have had huge interest in computer science.
